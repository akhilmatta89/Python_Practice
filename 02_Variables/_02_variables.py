# Variables are containers for storing data values.

# Python has no command for declaring a variable.

# A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.

# String variables can be declared either by using single or double quotes:

x = "John"
# is the same as
x = 'John'


x = 5   # Declaring a variable
y = "John"
print(x)  # Printing a variable
print(y)


# Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type, and can even change type after they have been set.

x = 4       # x is of type int
x = "Sally" # x is now of type str
print(x)


# If you want to specify the data type of a variable, this can be done with casting.

x = str(3)    # x will be '3'
print(x)
print(type(x))
y = int(3)    # y will be 3
print(y)
z = float(3)  # z will be 3.0
print(z)


a = 4
A = "Sally"
#A will not overwrite a
